 Project Overview: Sales & Inventory Analytics Platform
üéØ Goal
To build a realistic SQL-based retail and warehouse management system that:

Tracks sales, inventory, and supplier deliveries

Automates low stock alerts and stock transfers

Supports reporting and analytics via queries and dashboards

üß© Real-World Problems It Solves
Retail businesses struggle with managing stock levels, tracking supplier performance, and analyzing sales trends.

Manual inventory tracking is error-prone and lacks real-time insights.

There‚Äôs a need for automated actions like reordering and data-driven decision making.

This project creates a backend database system that supports all of the above, using SQL logic, views, and automation tools.

üìÖ Week-by-Week Breakdown
‚úÖ Week 1: Schema Design & Normalization
You identified the core business entities: Products, Customers, Orders, Payments, Suppliers, Warehouses, and Inventory Stock.

You designed a relational data model that reflects real-world business processes.

You normalized the schema to Third Normal Form (3NF) to reduce data redundancy and ensure data integrity.

You visualized the schema using a tool like dbdiagram.io or MySQL Workbench.

‚úÖ Week 2: Sample Data & Business Queries
You populated the database with realistic sample data (products, warehouses, orders, etc.).

You wrote analytical queries to:

Track total sales by product, category, and time period (e.g. month)

Monitor inventory levels across different warehouse locations

Evaluate supplier contributions (e.g. number of products supplied)

These queries provide actionable insights for management.

‚úÖ Week 3: Triggers, Procedures & Views
You used triggers to automate responses to events (like alerting when stock is low).

You created stored procedures to automate tasks (like transferring stock between warehouses).

You developed views to organize and simplify access to important data (like sales dashboards and reorder reports).

These features simulate backend intelligence in a real retail system.

‚úÖ Week 4: Final Reporting & Optimization
You added indexes on important fields to optimize query performance.

You exported data and reports to CSV files‚Äîwhich can be visualized in Excel, Power BI, or other tools.

You documented the entire project: schema design, logic used, key queries, and reporting methodology.

You prepared the system for BI and reporting integration, making it enterprise-ready.

üìÅ Final Project Deliverables (Non-Code)
A relational data model and ER diagram

A structured schema design with well-defined relationships

A set of sample data records

Business-centric query results (e.g., top-selling products, warehouse stock summaries)

Views, triggers, and stored procedures to simulate automation

Reports exported from the system

Documentation describing the schema, logic, insights, and structure
